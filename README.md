#LOSER
Simple App using vanilla JS for DOM rendering and Redux for state management.

The idea is to improve your resiliency by asking people for things.. the app calculates your score based on their response (1 point for YES and 10 points for NO)

UI should be self explanatory.. you can change the answer status by clicking on the question.
